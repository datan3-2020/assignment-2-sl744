## Read data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

setwd("C:/Users/simon/OneDrive/Documents/datan3_2019")
Egoalt8 <- read_tsv("data/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_w8/h_egoalt.tab")
Stable <- read_tsv("data/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_wx/xwavedat.tab")
Hh8 <- read_tsv("data/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_w8/h_hhresp.tab")

```

## Filter household roster data (10 points)

```{r}
Partners8 <- Egoalt8 %>%
        filter(h_relationship_dv == 1 | h_relationship_dv == 2) %>%
        select(pidp, apidp, h_hidp, h_relationship_dv, h_sex, h_asex)
```

```{r}
Hetero8 <- Partners8 %>%
        filter(h_sex == 2 & h_asex == 1) %>%
        filter(pidp[h_sex == 2], apidp[h_asex == 1]
        )
```

## Recode data on ethnicity (10 points)

```{r}
Stable2 <- Stable %>%
        select(pidp, racel_dv)
```

```{r}
Stable2 <- Stable2 %>%
        mutate(racel_dv = recode(racel_dv, `-9` = NA_real_))
```

```{r}

        mutate(race = recode(racel_dv,
                `1` = "White",

                `3` = "White",
                `4` = "White",
                .default = "non-White")
        )

## Join data (30 points)

```{r}

JoinedEthn <- Hetero8 %>%
        select(pidp, apidp, h_hidp) %>%
        left_join(Stable2, by = "pidp")

```

```{r}

        rename(alterRacel_dv = racel_dv) %>%
        rename(alterRace = race)
```

## Explore probabilities of racial endogamy (20 points)

```{r}
TableRace <- JoinedEthn %>%
        filter(egoRacel_dv > 0, alterRacel_dv > 0) %>%
        count(egoRace, alterRace)
TableRace

```

```{r}
TableRace %>%

        group_by(egoRace) %>%
        mutate(egoRacetot = 
                sum(n)) %>%
        mutate(prob = n/egoRacetot)
```

## Join with household data and calculate mean and median number of children by ethnic group (30 points)

```{r}

JoinedEthn2 <- Hh8 %>%
        select(h_hidp, h_nkids_dv) %>%
        full_join(JoinedEthn, by = "h_hidp")

JoinedEthn2 <- JoinedEthn2 %>%
        mutate(ethnendo = case_when(
                egoRacel_dv == 1 & alterRacel_dv == 1 ~ "White",
                egoRacel_dv == 9 & alterRacel_dv == 9 ~ "Indian",
                egoRacel_dv == 10 & alterRacel_dv == 10 ~ "Pakistani"
                
        )) %>%
        filter(ethnendo == "White" | ethnendo == "Indian" | ethnendo == "Pakistani")

tabkidrac <- JoinedEthn2 %>%
        select(h_hidp, h_nkids_dv, ethnendo) %>%
        group_by(ethnendo) %>%
        summarise(
                meankids = mean(h_nkids_dv, na.rm = TRUE),
                medkids = median(h_nkids_dv, na.rm = TRUE))

knitr::kable(
        tabkidrac,
        col.names = c("Family Ethnicity", "Average No. Kids", "Median No. Kids")
)
```

According to the table produced above, it would seem that Pakistani families of a heteronormative structure (i.e. mother and father) tend to have more children, with the average number of kids per household being twice that of Indian households, and over three times larger than the White British household average. But this result should be approached with caution, as within an sample, there inevitably exists some error, primarily due to the sampling technique used here. Simply looking at the total number of White British vs. Indian/Pakistani housholds (with available data pertaining to children per household), an overwhelming majority of the sample are White. This obviously creates problems in terms of measurement accuracy, as there is a clear gap in representation for racial minorities. This is likely due to non-response, given the accessibility of this survey, the amount of time it takes to complete (in addition to the annual commitment), and the personal questions it asks. So it is important to keep in mind the likelihood of innacuracy, especially when looking at data for Pakistani and Indian households.
